# Node DB Microservice

This is boilerpate code for my database server api with just the simplest of functionality.

It uses micro, mysql (can be changed), knex and objectionjs

TODO : 
  [ ] add function to check whether the required fields are there in the body
  kind of like this  
  ```json
    {
      required: ["",""],
      optional: ["",""]
    }
  ```
  [ ] adding a cache system
